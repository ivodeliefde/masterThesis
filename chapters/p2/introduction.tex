% Introduction to the subject
In 2008 the \ac{ogc} introduced a new set of standards called \ac{swe}. These standards make it possible to connect sensors to the internet and retrieve data in a uniform way. This allows users or applications to retrieve all kinds of sensor data, regardless of the type of observations or the sensor's manufacturer \citep{SW:Botts}. Among other standards \ac{swe} includes the \ac{om} which is a model for encoding sensor data, the \ac{sensorml} which is a model for describing sensor metadata and the \ac{sos} which is a service for retrieving sensor data \citep{SW:OGC}. 

Parallel to the development of the sensor web other research has focused on the semantic web, as proposed by \cite{LD:Berners-lee}. This is a response to the traditional way of using the web, where information is only available for humans to read. The semantic web is an extension of the internet which contains meaningful data that machines can interpret as well. Rather than publishing documents on the internet the semantic web contains linked data \citep{LD:Bizer}.    

\cite{SSW:Sheth} proposes to use semantic web technologies in the sensor web. This so-called \ac{ssw} builds on standards by \ac{ogc} and the \ac{w3c} "to provide enhanced descriptions and meaning to sensor data" \cite[p.78]{SSW:Sheth}. \ac{w3c} responded to this development with a standard ontology for sensor data on the semantic web \cite{SSW:SSN_incubatorGroup}. \\

\section{Background}
\cite{LD:Egenhofer} argues "there would exist a much higher potential for exploiting the Web if tools were available that better match human reasoning" \cite[p. 1]{LD:Egenhofer}. \cite{SSW:Sheth} proposed adding semantics to the sensor web which has resulted in the so-called \ac{ssw}. The \ac{swe} standards by the \ac{ogc} have been combined with ontologies in the \ac{ssw}  to add meaning to sensor data \citep{SSW:Pschorr, SSW:Henson}. The \ac{w3c} has contributed to this development by creating the \ac{ssn} ontology \citep{SSW:SSN_incubatorGroup}.

Smart cities can be defined as "enhanced city systems which use data and technology to achieve integrated management and interoperability" \citep[p. 18]{SC:Moir}. Research on smart cities has identified a number of potential uses for semantic sensor data. Often this is presented in the context of the \ac{iot} \citep{IOT:Zanelli, SSW:Perera}. 
\cite{IOT:Fell} describes the \ac{iot} as "the result of technological progress in many parallel and often overlapping fields, including those of embedded systems, ubiquitous and pervasive computing, mobile telephony, telemetry and machine-to-machine communication, wireless sensor networks, mobile computing, and computer networking" \cite[p. 11]{IOT:Fell}. \cite{SSW:Perera} argues that sensor data fusion plays an important role in the \ac{iot}. He defines sensor data fusion as "a data processing technique that associates, combines, aggregates, and integrates data from different sources" \cite[p. 2]{SSW:Perera}. 

To keep up with the developments of the \ac{iot} and the smart city \ac{ogc} has identified the role of their standards in the 'smart cities spatial information framework' \citep{SC:OGC}. This is in line with the smart city vision of \cite{SC:Townsend} for creating "an organically evolved set of open standards and software that anyone can build on" \citep[p. 290]{SC:Townsend}. \\

The \ac{inspire} directive requires the EU member states to provide sensor data about a number of environmental aspects such as air quality, atmospheric conditions and water quality \citep{SDI:INSPIRE2}. According to \ac{inspire} sensor data has to be available for citizens to discover, view and download as a service which is free of charge and which uses standards by \ac{ogc} and the \ac{iso}. However, this development is still work in progress \citep{SW:Kotsev}.   

\section{Problem Statement}
The vision of the \ac{iot} and the smart city is very appealing. However, there are still a number of missing links considering the role of the \ac{ssw}. First of all, current \ac{ssw} research focusses mainly on sensor data from a single source. It is therefore difficult to discover sensor data on the internet that can be queried using the \ac{swe} standards. Second of all, data from different sources cannot easily be shared, integrated, combined and aggregated for data fusion \citep{SSW:Wang, SSW:Ji, SSW:Corcho}. 

To overcome the issues of sensor data discovery and integration \cite{SSW:Janowicz} suggest a linked data model and a \ac{rest}ful proxy for \ac{ogc}â€™s \ac{sos}. They mention future work should focus on the 'Sensor Plug\&Play infrastructure' in which "sensors can by automatically registered" \cite[p. 21]{SSW:Janowicz}. Also, it is argued that these developments could lead to a \ac{micro-sdi} and will enable an ubiquitous geoweb.

\section{Use Case}
Providing temperature data of all EU member states is part of the \ac{inspire} program. This data is useful for mapping the effects of extreme temperatures on citizen's health and the environment. \cite{UC:vanderHoeven} and \cite{UC:vanderHoeven2} are examples of studies which aim to identify urban heat islands in cities. These studies require temperature data combined with statistics, based on addresses. This research will be used as an example use case for the added value of the semantic sensor web. 
 

\section{Research Question}
This thesis aims to gain knowledge on how to move the \ac{ssw} closer to an ubiquitous geoweb by answering the following research question: 

\textit{How can the semantic sensor web improve the discovery, integration and aggregation of distributed sensor data?}
