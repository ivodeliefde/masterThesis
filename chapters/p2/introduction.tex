\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

From 2020 onwards all member states of the \ac{eu} should provide sensor data to the \ac{inspire} in order to comply with annex II and III of the \ac{inspire} directive \citep{SDI:INSPIRE5}. For this a number of \ac{swe} standards are required to be used \citep{SDI:INSPIRE2}. The sensor web is a relatively new development and there are still many question on how to structure it. This thesis aims to develop a method to publish and link sensor metadata on the semantic web for discovering, integrating and aggregating sensor data.

% Introduction to the subject
\section{background}
In 2008 the \ac{ogc} introduced a new set of standards called \ac{swe}. These standards make it possible to connect sensors to the internet and retrieve data in a uniform way. This allows users or applications to retrieve all kinds of sensor data, regardless of the type of observations or the sensor's manufacturer \citep{SW:Botts}. Among other standards \ac{swe} includes the \ac{om} which is a model for encoding sensor data, the \ac{sensorml} which is a model for describing sensor metadata and the \ac{sos} which is a service for retrieving sensor data \citep{SW:OGC}. \ac{om} has also been adopted by the \ac{iso} under \ac{iso} 19156:2011 \cite{SW:ISO}. 

Recently \ac{ogc} has defined the role which their standards could play in smart city developments \citep{SC:OGC}. Smart cities can be defined as "enhanced city systems which use data and technology to achieve integrated management and interoperability" \citep[p. 18]{SC:Moir}. Research on smart cities has shown a great potential for using sensor data in urban areas. Often this is presented in the context of the \ac{iot} \citep{IOT:Zanelli, SSW:Perera}. The \ac{iot} can be described as "the pervasive presence around us of a variety of \textit{things} or \textit{objects} ... [which] are able to interact with each other and cooperate with their neighbors to reach common goals" \cite[p. 2787]{IOT:Atzori}. 

Parallel to the development of the sensor web other research has focused on the semantic web, as proposed by \cite{LD:Berners-lee}. This is a response to the traditional way of using the web, where information is only available for humans to read. The semantic web is an extension of the internet which contains meaningful data that machines can interpret as well. Rather than publishing documents on the internet the semantic web contains linked data using the \ac{rdf} \citep{LD:Bizer}.    

\cite{SSW:Sheth} proposes to use semantic web technologies in the sensor web. This so-called \ac{ssw} builds on standards by \ac{ogc} and the \ac{w3c} "to provide enhanced descriptions and meaning to sensor data" \cite[p.78]{SSW:Sheth}. \ac{w3c} responded to this development by developing a standard ontology for sensor data on the semantic web \citep{SSW:SSN_incubatorGroup}. 
 
% Problem statement
\section{Problem Statement}
The implementation of the sensor web is still in an early stage. \\

A number of companies and organisations still use their own custom APIs to connect sensors to the internet. \\

It is hard to find \ac{sos} services on the internet. \\

It has been argued that it is difficult to integrate sensor data from different sources to perform data fusion \citep{SSW:Corcho, SSW:Ji, SSW:Wang}. Data fusion is "a data processing technique that associates, combines, aggregates, and integrates data from different sources" \cite[p. 2]{SSW:Perera}. \\

\section{Related research}
\cite{SSW:Henson} and \cite{SSW:Pschorr} suggest adding semantic annotations to a \ac{sos} which they call semantically enabled \ac{sos} or Sem-SOS. In Sem-SOS the raw sensor data goes through a process of semantic annotating before it can be requested with a \ac{sos} service. The retrieved data is still an \ac{xml} document, but with embedded semantic terminology as defined in an ontology model. 

\cite{SSW:Janowicz} has specified a method that uses a \ac{rest}ful proxy as a fa\c{c}ade for \ac{sos}. When a specific \ac{uri} is requested the so-called \ac{sel} translates this to a \ac{sos} request, fetches the data and translates the results back to \ac{rdf}. In this method the sensor data is converted to \ac{rdf} on-the-fly.  

\cite{SSW:Stasch} propose to aggregate sensor data based on the geometry of sampling features. \cite{SSW:Stasch4} argue that in order for automatic aggregation to work there needs to be semantics on which kind of aggregation methods are appropriate for a specific kind of sensor data. This requires a formalisation of expert knowledge which they call semantic reference systems.

\cite{SW:Jones} looked into using a well-known \ac{ogc} standard for retrieving static geographic data - the \ac{wfs} - and how this could be applied to the semantic web.

\cite{SSW:Cox3} has been working on an improved semantic ontology based on \ac{om}. 

% Research question 
\section{Research question}
Sem-SOS \citep{SSW:Henson, SSW:Pschorr} as well as \ac{sel} \citep{SSW:Janowicz} focus on publishing meaningful sensor data, but do not address the integration and aggregation of sensor data. \cite{SSW:Stasch} suggests an interesting method for aggregating sensor data and publishing it on the semantic web based on spatial features. \cite{SSW:Stasch3} proposes a \ac{wps} that takes sensor data right from a \ac{sos} service in order to aggregate it. The approach by \cite{SSW:Stasch} takes sensor data as input that is already on the semantic web as linked data. This leads to a number of issues regarding the validity of the links after the aggregation process. The idea by \cite{SW:Jones} of delivering data to users through a service with which they are already familiar is very appealing, because it would enable sensor data to be immediately used in any existing \ac{gis}. However, \cite{SW:Jones} has been mainly concerned with static geographic data, not with (aggregated) sensor data. \\

This thesis aims to build on the recent literature by creating a method that uses the semantic web to improve sensor data discovery as well as the integration and aggregation of sensor data from heterogeneous sources. The following question will be answered in this research:   
\textit{How can the semantic web improve the discovery, integration and aggregation of distributed sensor data?}

\section{Use Case}
Providing temperature data of all EU member states is part of the \ac{inspire} program. This data is useful for mapping the effects of extreme temperatures on citizen's health and the environment. \cite{UC:vanderHoeven} and \cite{UC:vanderHoeven2} are examples of studies which aim to identify urban heat islands in cities. These studies require temperature data combined with statistics, based on addresses. This research will be used as an example use case for the added value of the semantic sensor web.
