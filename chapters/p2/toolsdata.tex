\section{Tools and Data}
\label{chap:TD}

The methods that will be researched in this thesis are also going to be tested in a prototype application. Creating a prototype requires data and software tools. This chapter briefly describes the tools and data that will be used.  

\subsection{Data}
\begin{sloppypar}
The data can be divided into static geographic data and sensor data. For static data the topographic data sets from the \ac{cbs} and the Dutch cadaster will be used. Shapefiles of Dutch neighbourhoods (wijken, figure \ref{fig:neighbourhoods}) have been downloaded from \url{http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/themas/dossiers/nederland-regionaal/publicaties/geografische-data/archief/2015/wijk-en-buurtkaart-2014-art.htm}. The dataset of Dutch provinces (provincies, figure \ref{fig:provinces}) and municipalities (gemeenten, figure \ref{fig:municipalities}) has been downloaded from \url{https://www.pdok.nl/nl/producten/pdok-downloads/basis-registratie-kadaster/bestuurlijke-grenzen-actueel}. It was very difficult to obtain data of administrative boundaries of Belgium (even from the \ac{inspire} data portal). Therefore, all data for Belgium was retrieved from \url{http://www.gadm.org/}.
\end{sloppypar}

Air quality sensor data will be used from the \ac{rivm} (\url{http://inspire.rivm.nl/sos/}) and from the \ac{ircel} (\url{http://sos.irceline.be/}). Both of these organisations have a \ac{sos} where data can be retrieved according to the \ac{swe} standards. They provide three kinds of sensor data: particulate matter ($PM_{10}$), nitrogen dioxide ($NO^{2}$) and ozone ($O^{3}$).

To store the static geographic data a spatial database will be created. A Postgres database will be used for this with the Postgis extension. With the plugin 'PostGIS 2.0 Shapefile and DBF loader' the downloaded shapefiles can be imported into the database.

\subsection{Prototype}
The methods researched in this thesis will be implemented in a prototype. The prototype will be written in the Python programming language and will use a number of Python packages and libraries:\\

\vbox{%
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Psycopg2 will be used to connect a Python script to a Postgres database.
	\item Python's \href{http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/}{Request} library will be used for making \ac{http} POST and GET requests. 
	\item For working with \ac{xml} Python's xml package will be used.
	\item To create \ac{rdf} documents the Python library \href{https://rdflib.readthedocs.org/en/stable/}{RDFLib} will be used. 
	\item The scripts will be part of a \ac{wps} using \href{http://pywps.wald.intevation.org/}{PyWPS} 
\end{itemize}}

\subsection{Server}
The prototyp will be created on a localhost at first. Once finished it could be hosted on the university server. For the localhost the Apache software will be used, since the PyWPS software requires this.
