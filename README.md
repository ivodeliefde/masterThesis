# MScGeomaticsThesisTemplate

A complete template for the [MSc Geomatics](http://geomatics.tudelft.nl) thesis.

It contains all the parts that are required and is structured in such a way that most/all supervisors expect.
Observe that the MSc Geomatics at TU Delft has no formal requirements (except the reflection part, which is put here as an Appendix, but it can also be submitted as a separate document), how the document looks like (fonts, margins, headers, etc) is entirely up to you. 
We basically took the template \texttt{arsclassica} (by Lorenzo Pantieri), which is an adaption of the original \texttt{classicthesis} package from AndrÃ© Miede, added the front/back matters (cover page, copyright, abstract, etc.), and gave examples for the insertion of figures, tables and algorithms.

> It is not an official template and it is not mandatory to use it.

But we hope it will encourage everyone to use LaTeX for writing their thesis, and we also hope that it will *discourage* some from using Word.


## How to get started with LaTeX?

Basically everything you need to know---from installation to details---is there available in [this free book](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX).

To compile this template, you need a full installation of [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/about) (Windows) or [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive) (cross-platform) or [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex) (OSX).
