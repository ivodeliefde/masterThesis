  Abstract                 = {This article presents an event and clustering analytics server that acts as an interface for novel analytical IoT services. The approach presented in this paper also demonstrates how sensor data acquired from mobile devices can be integrated within IoT platforms to enable analytics on data streams. It is based on the OpenIoT platform. The use case for evaluating the proposed solution is a mobile crowd-sensing application for air quality monitoring in a smart city environment, where users provide data streams with wearable sensors. In the framework of the OpenIoT project, the Intelligent OpenIoT server is the gateway for the Extended Global Sensor Networks (X-GSN) middleware. Working on annotated RDF data, Linked Sensor Middleware (LSM-Light) provides even more sophisticated means to filter and aggregate data. The X-GSN middleware can either push data to LSM-light or LSM-ligth can periodically pull data. 

Often individual sensor readings are not relevant but instead an aggregated value is required. The three levels (physical, virtual (X-GSN) and semantic (LSM) feature different aggregation capabilities.

The data was split into 2 hours non-overlapping time windows. They used the coordinates to spatially group the data by means of the k-means clustering algorithm with predefined cluster centroids. 

The analytics they perform as well as the middleware architecture might be relevant for my thesis. This article takes IoT sensors and maps them as RDF. Pretty much like my idea, but for openIoT instead of SWE (see figure 1) and not taking vector features into consideration.},

It looks at different spatial vocabularies for linking spatial data to the internet: the ISA Programme Location Core Vocabulary, NeoGeo Vocabulary, schema.org, the OGC standard GeoSPARQL, the W3C Geospatial Vocabulary and stRDF. stRDF is an extension to RDF wherein a triple is extended with a fourth element: time, which is not yet exploited.

Also mentions how to create RDF mappings on the fly. However, it hasn't been used in this thesis since the software it used was not compatible with spatial features and software that was compatible (Oracle DB) was not available at the time.},
