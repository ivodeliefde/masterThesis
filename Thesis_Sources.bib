  Abstract                 = {This article presents an event and clustering analytics server that acts as an interface for novel analytical IoT services. The approach presented in this paper also demonstrates how sensor data acquired from mobile devices can be integrated within IoT platforms to enable analytics on data streams. It is based on the OpenIoT platform. The use case for evaluating the proposed solution is a mobile crowd-sensing application for air quality monitoring in a smart city environment, where users provide data streams with wearable sensors. In the framework of the OpenIoT project, the Intelligent OpenIoT server is the gateway for the Extended Global Sensor Networks (X-GSN) middleware. Working on annotated RDF data, Linked Sensor Middleware (LSM-Light) provides even more sophisticated means to filter and aggregate data. The X-GSN middleware can either push data to LSM-light or LSM-ligth can periodically pull data. 

Often individual sensor readings are not relevant but instead an aggregated value is required. The three levels (physical, virtual (X-GSN) and semantic (LSM) feature different aggregation capabilities.

The data was split into 2 hours non-overlapping time windows. They used the coordinates to spatially group the data by means of the k-means clustering algorithm with predefined cluster centroids. 

The analytics they perform as well as the middleware architecture might be relevant for my thesis. This article takes IoT sensors and maps them as RDF. Pretty much like my idea, but for openIoT instead of SWE (see figure 1) and not taking vector features into consideration.},

  Abstract                 = {This article shows how the collaboratively collected OpenStreetMap data can be transformed and represented adhering to the RDF data model, how this data can be interlinked with other spatial data sets and how it can be made accessible for machines according to the linked data paradigm.

This is similar to my thesis research: using OSM data as RDF to interlink spatial datasets on the semantic web. However, I would like to extend this with sensor data: linking sensor data sets together based on OSM data as RDF.

Mapping OSM into RDF resulted in 2 billion triples(!) that are difficult to handle by existing triple stores. For example, lat/long coordinates can be stored far more efficiently with by relational database indexing techniques. As a result of these considerations, the article proposes a mixed approach in which part of the data is stored in relations and another part is stored according to the RDF data model. They also identify a number of considerations which improved the performance. One of which was an optimized import script which imports the OSM XML 3-5 times faster thatn the Osmosis tool.

Part of the ontology is deriveed from the relational representation (see figure 3 page 6). A major source of strucutre, however, are the OSM tags i.e. attribute-value annotations to nodes, ways and relations.

The article mentions how LinkedGeoData has been matched to DBPedia (first restricted to objects with latitude, longitude properties, but furter research should extend this).

Related work this article mentions: There is a large body of work dedicated to converting relational databases to RDF and OWL. The W3C RDB2RDF incubator group, which we are participating in, has the aim to classify and standardize such approaches.},

The article describes how to link sensors to the semantic web using the SSN. It also addresses the spatial component where the location of a sensor can be used for querying the sensor data. This is done by using a WKT point filter in which the coordinates are entered in the query (page 17) or using a map interface (page 22).

  Abstract                 = {This article presents 'XGSN': an open-source system that relies on semantic representations of sensor metadata and observations, to guide the process of annotating and publishing sensor data on the Web. It is based on the SSN ontology. It shows how this approach has been implemented in XGSN, and incorporated to the wider OpenIoT platform, providing a highly flexible and scalable system for managing the life-cycle of sensor data, from acquisition to publishing, in the context of the semantic Web of Things.

The article describes XGSN, a middleware solution that handles the lifecycle of virtual sensors (devices, objects or people observing properties around them), providing semantic annotations for them and the observation data that they produce.

Two main types of semantic annotations have been added in XGSN for virtual sensors. First of all, the metadata annotations related to sensors, sensing devices and their capabilities, eg the sensing device that produces the data in a particular virtual sensor, its location, the type of observation it produces, the responsible person or organization, the source type, etc. Second of all, metadata related to the observations or measurements produced continuously by the sensors. This includes the semantic information that describes the time and context when the observation happened, the observed property, unit, the values themselves, etc. XGSN considers the location of the virtual sensor, which is annotated with geo-location vocabularies.

This article uses the OpenIoT platform (\url{https://github.com/OpenIotOrg/openiot/wiki}) which currently only runs on Linux systems. The architecture principles are very interesting. ALso, at the end of the article (paragraph 6) describes related work.},

  Abstract                 = {Many SWE applications are ill equipped at handling raw sensor data as provided by SOS and require actionable knowledge of the environment in order to be practically useful. There are two approaches to deal with this obstacle, make the applications smarter or make the data smarter. We propose the latter option and accomplish this by leveraging semantic technologies in order to provide and apply more meaningful representation of sensor data.

This paper presents an architecture in which semantics are added to the sensor data before it can be queried by SOS. The SOS request therefore creates a SPARQL query on the server side. This is useful for working with a single data source, but makes combining data sources more complicated (especially if other sources use 'normal' SOS instead of SemSOS). They have used the 52 North SOS architecture as a foundation for the SemSOS prototype.

It also mentions that in order to encode relationships in XML, the OGC-SWE often make use of XLink, XML Linking Language, a markup language that 'allows elements to be inserted into XML documents in order to create and describe links between resources'. However, they argue that the triple-pattern approach of RDF provides a far more natural and useful approach to encoding relationships. Still, they use XLink to output semantic data in SOS via XML. 

This article uses OWL to represent the O&M data which is normally in XML. They state: ' translation between O&M in OWL and O&M in XML is straightforward and thus allows SemSOS to remain SOS compliant' (for the mapping: see figure 3 on page 4). For the time aspect they use the ontology 'OWL-Time' , which allows for temporal calculus, provides descriptions of temporal concepts such as owl-time:instant and owl-time:interval, which supports defining interval queries such as within, contains, and overlaps.},

Nonetheless it is an import reference for my research since the idea of the "information oriented architecture" which allows the sensor data to be understood and
processed in a meaningful way by a variety of applications with different purposes is similar to my idea of the SSW.

Since the W3C SSN standard has only been created after the publication of this article it does not implement it yet.

The article states very well the relevance of this kind of research: while SWE standards are very useful, they are by themselves insufficient to realize knowledge-based reasoning and discovery and it does not state essence relations among data clearly. In order to obtain further information and knowledge, researchers propose SSW by adding semantics through domain ontology and spatial and temporal ontology to the existing sensor network language standards.

We believe SSW, combining SWE with semantic web and ontology, is considered as a framework that enhances the expressiveness of sensor data, provides abundant and meaningful semantic descriptions, and realizes sensor knowledge reasoning.

In this article 5 areas for future research are presented: Real-time Search in Semantic Sensor Web, Ontology Construction for Semantic Sensor Web, Data Fusion in Semantic Sensor Web, Semantic Annotations in semantic Sensor Web, and Application Developments methodology for Semantic Sensor Web. About data fusion in the semantic web is states: Recent research trends focus on transforming the sensor-based data into RDF and making it available using HTTP with the help of sensor-related URIs.

This article discusses a semantic sensor Web (SSW) in which sensor data is annotated with semantic metadata to increase interoperability as well as provide
contextual information essential for situational knowledge. In particular, this involves annotating sensor data with spatial, temporal, and thematic semantic metadata. A semantically rich sensor network would provide spatial, temporal, and thematic information essential for discovering and analyzing sensor data.

Whereas the languages provided by the OGC SWE provide annotations for simple spatial and temporal concepts such as spatial coordinate and time stamp, more abstract concepts, such as spatial region, temporal interval, or any domain-specific thematic entity, would benefit from an ontological representation’s expressiveness. 

The semantics of the time interval specified by the query could be about weather conditions that fall within the time interval, contain the time interval, or overlap with the time interval.

The article briefly explains the mapping between XML and RDFa (page 81). 

It mentions that: several efforts are also underway to design an expressive geospatial ontology, including the W3C Geospatial Incubator Group and the Geographic Markup Language Ontology of the OGC. The results of this effort are presented in Compton et al. (2012).

The article states that to derive additional knowledge from semantically annotated sensor data, it’s necessary to define and use rules. For this they use Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)- based rules over OWL ontologies.

The use cases presented here involve semantics for better understanding the data from a single source. There is no mentioning of integrating sensor data from different sources based on semantics.},

This Article presents a pilot platform that uses several OGC SWE standards.

This paper focusses on smart devices such as a smart car that consumes and produces real-world information which is integrated into the SSW.

The term Sensor Web refers to an infrastructure with automatic mechanisms to allow applications to discover and access particular information provided by sensors networks over the Internet. Standardization efforts like SWE still need to be extended to all the interfaces that can be identified between the lower layer, represented by sensor networks and smart devices, and the upper layer of final applications. In our view, the OGC SWE represents a mature standard interface between the Sensor Web Layer and the Application Layer. Universal standards for the interface between the Sensor Web and the underlying Sensor Layer, however, are still an open issue. My research focuses on the relation between Sensor Web Layer and the Application Layer as well and not on the relation between Sensor Web and the underlying Sensor Layer.},

  Abstract                 = {This article introduces the concept of IoT and presents in detail ten different parameters that govern their sensor data fusion evaluation framework. The main goal is to examine and survey different sensor data fusion research efforts based on our evaluation framework. 

The concept of Sensor Data Fusion is described as well its relevance in the IoT. It can be described as a data processing technique that associates, combines, aggregates, and integrates data fromdifferentsources. The article mentions three key operations of sensor data fusion: complementary (creating a large picture from small bits of information), redundant (integrate sensors for improved accuracy), and cooperative (combine sensors to produce new knowledge). The ultimate goal of sensor data fusion is to under- stand the environment and act accordingly. 

My thesis will be focused on the complementary and redundant aspects of sensor data fusion with the future option of cooperative through links in the semantic web. 

There is very little interest in the raw sensor data. The data that is of significant interest is information about interesting events that are happening in the specific area.

The ten parameters are: Middleware Architecture Type, Context-awareness, Semantic Interaction, Dynamic Configuration, Fusion Complexity, Actuation Management, Type of Processing, Cross Domain Portability, Implementation and Performance Evaluation.

Using middleware in semantic sensor network architectures is about creating an abstraction level, which results in a degraded performance over applications that directly consult the sensors. However, middleware systems can bundle important functionalities together to be reused in many applications. The article identifies developing middleware as the right way to address the needs of IoT applications.

Connecting sensors to the semantic web (Semantic Sensor Web) is mentioned as an important step to increase the retrievability of sensor data.

The article describes the potential of IoT and evaluates a number of 'state of the art' examples of Sensor Data Fusion. Table 1: Taxonomy of Sensor Data Fusion Research Efforts contains a taxonomy of a couple dozen researches.},

This paper focusses specifically to an urban IoT system that, while still being quite a broad category, are characterized by their specific application domain. 

Under the political dimension, the primary obstacle is the attribution of decision-making power to the different stakeholders. On the technical side, the most relevant issue consists in the noninteroperability of the heterogeneous technologies currently used in city and urban developments. In this respect, the IoT vision can become the building block to realize a unified urbanscale ICT platform.

A number of use cases are identified: Structural Health of Buildings, Waste Management, Air Quality, Noise Monitoring, Traffic Congestion, City Energy Consumption, Smart Lighting and Automation and Salubrity of Public Buildings.

A fundamental aspect is the necessity to make (part of) the data collected by the urban IoT easily accessible by authorities and citizens, to increase the responsiveness of authorities to city problems, and to promote the awareness and the participation of citizens in public matters.

The paper mentions that XML is often too verbose and large for small IoT devices and therefore W3C has developed the EXI format, which makes it possible even for very constrained devices to natively support and generate messages using an open data format compatible with XML.},
