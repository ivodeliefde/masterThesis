  Abstract                 = {Sensor technology and sensor networks have
evolved so rapidly that they are now considered a core driver
of the Internet of Things (IoT), however data analytics on IoT
streams is still in its infancy. This paper introduces an
approach to sensor data analytics by using the OpenIoT1
middleware; real time event processing and clustering
algorithms have been used for this purpose. The OpenIoT
platform has been extended to support stream processing and
thus we demonstrate its flexibility in enabling real time ondemand
application domain analytics. We use mobile crowdsensed
data, provided in real time from wearable sensors, to
analyse and infer air quality conditions. This experimental
evaluation has been implemented using the design principles
and methods for IoT data interoperability specified by the
OpenIoT project. We describe an event and clustering
analytics server that acts as an interface for novel analytical
IoT services. The approach presented in this paper also
demonstrates how sensor data acquired from mobile devices
can be integrated within IoT platforms to enable analytics on
data streams. It can be regarded as a valuable tool to
understand complex phenomena, e.g., air pollution dynamics
and its impact on human health.},

  Review                   = {This article presents an event and clustering analytics server that acts as an interface for novel analytical IoT services. The approach presented in this paper also demonstrates how sensor data acquired from mobile devices can be integrated within IoT platforms to enable analytics on data streams. It is based on the OpenIoT platform. The use case for evaluating the proposed solution is a mobile crowd-sensing application for air quality monitoring in a smart city environment, where users provide data streams with wearable sensors. In the framework of the OpenIoT project, the Intelligent OpenIoT server is the gateway for the Extended Global Sensor Networks (X-GSN) middleware. Working on annotated RDF data, Linked Sensor Middleware (LSM-Light) provides even more sophisticated means to filter and aggregate data. The X-GSN middleware can either push data to LSM-light or LSM-ligth can periodically pull data. 

Often individual sensor readings are not relevant but instead an aggregated value is required. The three levels (physical, virtual (X-GSN) and semantic (LSM) feature different aggregation capabilities.

The data was split into 2 hours non-overlapping time windows. They used the coordinates to spatially group the data by means of the k-means clustering algorithm with predefined cluster centroids. 

The analytics they perform as well as the middleware architecture might be relevant for my thesis. This article takes IoT sensors and maps them as RDF. Pretty much like my idea, but for openIoT instead of SWE (see figure 1) and not taking vector features into consideration.},

to traditional authoritative and reliably sourced geospatial data, SDIs increasingly

networks and crowd-sourced message databases. These new data come
with variable, loosely defined, and sometimes unknown provenance, semantics,
and content. The next generation of SDIs will need the capability to integrate
and federate geospatial data that are highly heterogeneous. These data
comprise a vast observation space: they could be represented in many forms,
will have been generated by a variety of producers using different processes
and will have originally been intended for purposes that may differ markedly
from their later use. There are several discriminative dimensions along which
we can describe the properties of the data found in SDIs, such as the data
structure, the spatial framework (e.g., field, image, or object-based), the semantics
of the attributes, the author or producer, the licensing, etc. These
dimensions define a universe of model possibilities for data in an SDI, known
as a model space. A core research challenge remains to recognise and resolve
- to the degree possible - a comprehensive set of model dimensions that will
enable us to characterise the many possible models by which geospatial data
can be represented. A second challenge is to describe the transformations
within and between models, and the ways in which these transformations
change aspects of the underlying model. Despite recent movement toward
semantically described services for SDIs, the scope and range of descriptive
dimensions for geospatial data are underspecified. In this paper we present
a diverse set of important dimensions that point to a series of challenges for
data integration and then describe how both traditional and emergent datasets
can be characterised within these dimensions, and point to some interesting
differences.},

  Abstract                 = {Information about localized phenomena may be represented in multiple
ways. GIS systems may be used to record the spatial extent of the phenomena.
Observations about the state of one or more properties of the phenomena
are available from real-time sensors, models, or from archives. The relationships
between these data sources, or specific features in different data products,
cannot easily be specified. Additionally, features change over time, their representations
use different spatial scales and different aspects of them are of
concern to different stakeholders. This greatly increases the number of potential
relationships between features. Thus, for a given feature we can expect that
heterogeneous information systems will exist, holding different types of data
related to that feature. We propose the use of Linked Data to describe the relationships
between them. We demonstrate this in practice using the Australian
Hydrologic Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric) feature dataset and observational data
of varying forms, including time-series and discrete measurements. We describe
how different resources, and different aspects and versions of them, can be
discovered and accessed. A web client is described that can navigate between related
resources, including using the Geofabric’s feature relationships, to navigate
from one observational dataset to another related by hydrological connectivity.},

  Review                   = {This paper describes how we have used Linked Data to describe how alternate data product representations and observational data may be linked to specific features. We show further how domain models can be used to standardize and document links between different features. It focusses on the use of Linked Data for enabling hydrological and spatial data infrastructures.

The prototype preseted in this paper shows how the linking of different data sets via the semantic web can be used to discover how other data sets measure the same feature. A monitoring point can be selected and then a request can be made to retrieve ‘alternates’ views of this feature. This is similar to my idea of linking sensor data sources, but leaves a certain amount of manual steps. When you retrieve the different data sources with their relations (contains, within, touching, etc. ) you still need to use that in new requests.

The article describes the necessity of moving away from the 'dataset' centric approaches towards linking data from distributed heterogeneous data sources.},

the RDF data model, how this data can be interlinked with other spatial

This is similar to my thesis research: using OSM data as RDF to interlink spatial datasets on the semantic web. However, I would like to extend this with sensor data: linking sensor data sets together based on OSM data as RDF.

Mapping OSM into RDF resulted in 2 billion triples(!) that are difficult to handle by existing triple stores. For example, lat/long coordinates can be stored far more efficiently with by relational database indexing techniques. As a result of these considerations, the article proposes a mixed approach in which part of the data is stored in relations and another part is stored according to the RDF data model. They also identify a number of considerations which improved the performance. One of which was an optimized import script which imports the OSM XML 3-5 times faster thatn the Osmosis tool.

Part of the ontology is deriveed from the relational representation (see figure 3 page 6). A major source of strucutre, however, are the OSM tags i.e. attribute-value annotations to nodes, ways and relations.

The article mentions how LinkedGeoData has been matched to DBPedia (first restricted to objects with latitude, longitude properties, but furter research should extend this).

Related work this article mentions: There is a large body of work dedicated to converting relational databases to RDF and OWL. The W3C RDB2RDF incubator group, which we are participating in, has the aim to classify and standardize such approaches.},

of phenomena in our environment. The vision of the semantic sensor web is to enable
the interoperability of various applications that use sensor data provided by semantically

achieve this vision. More particularly, mechanisms that can support context-aware semantic
mapping and that can adapt to the dynamic metadata of sensors are required. Semantic
mapping for the sensor web is required to support sensor data fusion, sensor data discovery
and retrieval, and automatic semantic annotation, to name only a few tasks. This paper
presents a context-aware ontology-based semanticmediation service for heterogeneous
sensor services. The semantic mediation service is context-aware and dynamic because it
takes into account the real-time variability of thematic, spatial, and temporal elements that
describe sensor data in different contexts. The semantic mediation service integrates rulebased
reasoning to support the resolution of semantic heterogeneities. An application scenario
is presented showing how the semantic mediation service can improve sensor data

The new generation of SWE adds further functionalities to the SWE framework, which is also not yet approved as standards:
Eventing mechanisms which advance the basic alerting functionality of the first generation SWE specifications.
Discovery of sensor resources and sensor observables.

In conventional SDIs consisting of servers providing maps, coverages or geometric features, data discovery is usually covered by the OGC Catalogue. Due to the specifics of sensor networks, this approach is not directly applicable for the Sensor Web.

There are a kind of catalogue services for SWE: The Sensor Instance Registry (SIR) for harvesting, managing and transforming sensor metadata as well as the Sensor Observable Registry (SOR) for managing the semantics of the phenomena observed by sensors.

In order to achieve this aim, the SIR provides functionality to: collect sensor metadata (i.e., automatic harvesting of SensorML documents and manual insertion of sensor metadata), provide extended discovery functionality based on the metadata provided through SensorML, manage status information of sensors (e.g., finding all sensors with a critical battery level or automatic notification if a sensor reaches a critical state), transform SensorML-based sensor metadata into conventional Catalogue information models and push the transformed metadata sets into OGC Catalogue instances

In order to support users when dealing with identifiers pointing to phenomenon definitions, the SOR interface has been designed. It provides functionality to: retrieve a list of known phenomenon identifiers so that a user can select those identifiers that fit to his needs, resolve phenomenon identifiers (i.e., returning a dictionary entry describing what a certain phenomenon identifier means), find related phenomena so that sensor discovery requests can be semantically enhanced (e.g., searching for all sensors that measure some kind of temperature)

In the future it is expected that more generic approaches will be developed that support not only the handling of phenomenon definitions but also other kinds of names and identifiers (e.g., for sensor types, units of measurement, etc.).

The ability to dynamically integrate sensors is still an unresolved challenge within SWE. An on-the-fly integration of sensors into the Sensor Web with a minimum of human intervention is not straight- forward with the given methods. Especially in hazard or disaster situations, a live deployment or densification of sensor networks and an ad-hoc integration of those sensors into the Sensor Web to allow multiple parties an easy access and usage of the sensors must be enabled.

The presented approaches of the Semantic Sensor Web and linked sensor data build a solid basis for future efforts in this research area. Much work still remains to be done. From the perspective of SWE, a central challenge is semantic enablement of SWE specifications and incorporation into the OGC standardization process. This is needed to pave the way to utilization of those methods in real world applications.},

environmental data, or observations, in a standardized way. Thereby, the SOS offers
flexible spatial, temporal, and thematic filtering capabilities that enable clients to query

already in version 2.0 [6] and applied in many projects and organizational
infrastructures (see e.g., [4]). The data encoding leveraged by SOS is the Observations
& Measurements (O&M) standard, which is been introduced in the INSPIRE data
specification through the Guidelines for the use of O&M. O&M data can also be
accessed through the Web Feature Service (WFS), which has been incorporated in
INSPIRE [2] as an implementation of the INSPIRE Download Service [1]. However,
the WFS interface is very generic and not optimized for O&M data access. So, an
inclusion of the SOS in the INSPIRE Technical Guidance (TG) is desired. Hence, this
work analyses the SOS specification on how it can be enhanced to conform to the
implementation rules for INSPIRE download services.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensor network deployments are a primary source of massive
amounts of data about the real world that surrounds us, measuring a
wide range of physical properties in real time. However, in large-scale
deployments it becomes hard to eectively exploit the data captured
by the sensors, since there is no precise information about what devices
are available and what properties they measure. Even when metadata is
available, users need to know low-level details such as database schemas
or names of properties that are specic to a device or platform. Therefore
the task of coherently searching, correlating and combining sensor data
becomes very challenging. We propose an ontology-based approach, that
consists in exposing sensor observations in terms of ontologies enriched
with semantic metadata, providing information such as: which sensor
recorded what, where, when, and in which conditions. For this, we allow
dening virtual semantic streams, whose ontological terms are related to
the underlying sensor data schemas through declarative mappings, and
can be queried in terms of a high level sensor network ontology.},

This paper proposes a framework that enables efficient ontology-based querying of sensor data in a federated sensor network using the W3 SSN ontology.

The article describes how to link sensors to the semantic web using the SSN. It also addresses the spatial component where the location of a sensor can be used for querying the sensor data. This is done by using a WKT point filter in which the coordinates are entered in the query (page 17) or using a map interface (page 22).

It describes that the implementation in this article does not use the OGC SWE standards. However, they do mention this as future research.},

able to handle the data acquisition process of a wide number of devices
and protocols, and is designed as a highly extensible platform, leveraging
on the existing capabilities of the Global Sensor Networks (GSN) middleware.
Going beyond traditional sensor management systems, XGSN
is capable of enriching virtual sensor descriptions with semantically annotated
content using standard vocabularies. In the proposed approach,
sensor data and observations are annotated using an ontology network
based on the SSN ontology, providing a standardized queryable representation
that makes it easier to share, discover, integrate and interpret
the data. XGSN manages the annotation process for the incoming sensor
observations, producing RDF streams that are sent to the cloud-enabled
Linked Sensor Middleware, which can internally store the data or perform
continuous query processing. The distributed nature of XGSN allows deploying
different remote instances that can interchange observation data,
so that virtual sensors can be aggregated and consume data from other
remote virtual sensors. In this paper we show how this approach has
been implemented in XGSN, and incorporated to the wider OpenIoT
platform, providing a highly flexible and scalable system for managing
the life-cycle of sensor data, from acquisition to publishing, in the context

It shows how this approach has been implemented in XGSN, and incorporated to the wider OpenIoT platform, providing a highly flexible and scalable system for managing the life-cycle of sensor data, from acquisition to publishing, in the context of the semantic Web of Things.

The article describes XGSN, a middleware solution that handles the lifecycle of virtual sensors (devices, objects or people observing properties around them), providing semantic annotations for them and the observation data that they produce.

Two main types of semantic annotations have been added in XGSN for virtual sensors. First of all, the metadata annotations related to sensors, sensing devices and their capabilities, eg the sensing device that produces the data in a particular virtual sensor, its location, the type of observation it produces, the responsible person or organization, the source type, etc. Second of all, metadata related to the observations or measurements produced continuously by the sensors. This includes the semantic information that describes the time and context when the observation happened, the observed property, unit, the values themselves, etc. XGSN considers the location of the virtual sensor, which is annotated with geo-location vocabularies.

This article uses the OpenIoT platform (\url{https://github.com/OpenIotOrg/openiot/wiki}) which currently only runs on Linux systems. The architecture principles are very interesting. ALso, at the end of the article (paragraph 6) describes related work.},

from OGC and ISO 19156. Previous efforts, (a) through the W3C SSN project, and (b) following ISO rules for
conversion from UML, had dependencies on elaborate pre-existing ontologies and frameworks. The new ontologies,
known as om-lite and sam-lite, remove such dependencies, and can therefore be used with minimal ontological
commitment beyond the O&M conceptual model. Time and space concepts, for which there are multiple existing
solutions, are implemented as stub-classes, and patterns for linking to the existing ontologies are described. PROV
is used to support certain requirements for the description of specimens. A more general alignment of both observation
and sampling feature ontologies with PROV is described, as well as mappings to some other observation
models and ontologies.},

  Review                   = {This paper addresses the following issues of the W3C SSN ontology: SSN omits sampling features, it inherets conflicting classes from DOLCE and the UML-OWL conversion rule used for OMU triggers a web of dependencies on additional, sometimes highly detailed, ontologies derived from other ISO 19100-series UML models. Therefore, they introduce a new OWL implementation of O&M which aims to overcome these limitations with two new ontologies. 

The new ontology for observations, known as “omlite” (namespace prefix “oml:”), covers the key classes from O&M. However, where the UML model imported classes from other ISO 19100-series UML models, in om-lite these are implemented as local stubs. The stub classes support the definition of classes which have constraints involving these types, but do not commit the user to any specific existing vocabulary for geometric or temporal objects. Six core properties characterize an observation: featureOfInterest, observedProperty, procedure, phenomenonTime (time range of how long measurement applies), resultTime (time stamp of when measured) and result.

The ontology for sampling features, known as “sam-lite” (namespace prefix “samfl:”) includes all the classes from the O&M Sampling Features model. At least one samfl:sampledFeature property will be present, whose value indicates the intention of the sampling feature. samfl:GeometryObject and its specializations are stub classes. A user can select any suitable vocabulary that implements these classes, such as GeoSPARQL [43] or W3C Basic Geo [3].},

Each data provider may process and assess datasets differently before making them available
online. This information is often invisible to end users. Therefore, publishing observation
data with quality descriptions is vital as it helps users to assess the suitability of data
for their applications. It is also important to capture contextual information concerning
data quality such as provenance to trace back incorrect data to its origins. In the Open
Geospatial Consortium (OGC)’s Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework, there is no
sufficiently and practically applicable approach how these aspects can be systematically
represented and made accessible. This paper presents Q-SOS—an extension of the OGC’s
Sensor Observation Service (SOS) that supports retrieval of observation data together with
quality descriptions. These descriptions are represented in an observation data model
covering various aspects of data quality assessment. The service and the data model
have been developed based on open standards and open source tools, and are productively
being used to share observation data from the TERENO observatory infrastructure. We
discuss the advantages of deploying the presented solutions from data provider and
consumer viewpoints. Enhancements applied to the related open-source developments are
also introduced.},

  Review                   = {This article addresses the fact that OGC's standard Sensor Observation Service does not support quality descriptions of the sensor data. Therefore, Q-SOS is presented, which is an extension of SOS.

The specific problem with the current SOS is that is unclear how various aspects of data quality (e.g., quality flags and levels) associated with different sensing applications can be represented in relation to existing observation concepts, and then made accessible to users via the standard service.

One important aspect in modeling data quality is granularity, i.e., the level of details at which quality information of observation data is specified, e.g., at a time instant or a time interval for a given time series, or a collection of several data series. Data granularity may subject to the context of use. In the context of SOS servers, the quality information can be specified in a SensorML file if it refers the whole sensing process or in an O&M document if it applies to measurement values. Q-SOS's data model considers both levels of granularities.

the Sensors Anywhere (SANY) project is a very similar approach, but SANY only focuses on quality flags.},

that currently available methods for finding and using information

data repository to an information resource, a totally new way of
organizing information is needed. The advent of the Semantic
Web promises better retrieval methods by incorporating the data’s
semantics and exploiting the semantics during the search process.
Such a development needs special attention from the geospatial
perspective so that the particularities of geospatial meaning are
captured appropriately. The creation the Semantic Geospatial Web
needs the development multiple spatial and terminological
ontologies, each with a formal semantics; the representation of
those semantics such that they are available both to machines for
processing and to people for understanding; and the processing of
geospatial queries against these ontologies and the evaluation of
the retrieval results based on the match between the semantics of
the expressed information need and the available semantics of the
information resources and search systems. This will lead to a new
framework for geospatial information retrieval based on the
semantics of spatial and terminological ontologies. By explicitly
representing the role of semantics in different components of the
information retrieval process (people, interfaces, search systems,
and information resources), the Semantic Geospatial Web will
enable users to retrieve more precisely the data they need, based
on the semantics associated with these data.},

  Abstract                 = {“In a few decades’ time, computers
will be interwoven into almost every
industrial product”, wrote computer
scientist Karl Steinbuch in 1966.
Coupled with connectivity, this
prediction is finally coming to fruition.
It is called the ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT)
and it has the potential to change every
aspect of the economy, society, politics
and the environment.
This roadmap therefore takes the
reader on a journey, starting with
an examination of the IoT’s principal
characteristics, massive scale and
impact. To bring things to life it
provides concrete examples and
demonstrates how the IoT is heading
towards a world of ‘Everything-as-a-
Service’ (XaaS).
The roadmap then examines
the technology that makes the IoT
possible - a world of sensors, actuators,
microcontrollers, connectivity and the
cloud. From here it explores how a
complex and scattered value chain is
bringing this technology architecture to
market.
This leads the roadmap to address
the future governance of the IoT. For
if the IoT is to deliver on its promise of
a better world then it is going to need
to successfully address a whole series
of powers, rights and interests. These
include power over network standards,
power over products and their
distribution, power over network traffic,
as well as power over services and their
distribution. Rights, such as property
and privacy, are going to need to be
safeguarded. Security is going to have
to be guaranteed, as is competition in
the marketplace. With a plethora of IoT
stakeholder interests dispersed across
a highly fluid value chain this is not a
trivial task.
To assist with developing good
governance in the IoT this roadmap
proposes a three step process. This
process is grounded in the ‘Smarter
Intervention in Complex Systems’
methodology. It dovetails the IoT’s
value chain with a regulatory framework
for balancing power, rights and
interests.
If the IoT can be nudged in the right
direction then there is no limit on its
potential to enhance our lives.},

There are two approaches to deal with this obstacle, make the applications smarter or make the data smarter. We propose the latter option and accomplish this by leveraging semantic technologies in order to provide and apply more meaningful representation of sensor data.

This paper presents an architecture in which semantics are added to the sensor data before it can be queried by SOS. The SOS request therefore creates a SPARQL query on the server side. This is useful for working with a single data source, but makes combining data sources more complicated (especially if other sources use 'normal' SOS instead of SemSOS). They have used the 52 North SOS architecture as a foundation for the SemSOS prototype.

It also mentions that in order to encode relationships in XML, the OGC-SWE often make use of XLink, XML Linking Language, a markup language that 'allows elements to be inserted into XML documents in order to create and describe links between resources'. However, they argue that the triple-pattern approach of RDF provides a far more natural and useful approach to encoding relationships. Still, they use XLink to output semantic data in SOS via XML. 

This article uses OWL to represent the O&M data which is normally in XML. They state: ' translation between O&M in OWL and O&M in XML is straightforward and thus allows SemSOS to remain SOS compliant' (for the mapping: see figure 3 on page 4). For the time aspect they use the ontology 'OWL-Time' , which allows for temporal calculus, provides descriptions of temporal concepts such as owl-time:instant and owl-time:interval, which supports defining interval queries such as within, contains, and overlaps.},

the questions of what causes the urban heat island and who will be affected by it. Landuse does affect the
surface temperature. The difference between the areas in the city with the least and the greatest impervious
surface coverage accounts for an average land surface temperature difference of 11.6C per hectare.
The study demonstrates furthermore that the vulnerability of people and buildings to the urban heat
island effect is a local condition in which the energy efficiency of buildings, quality of life and demographic
factors should all be considered in an approach that is sensitive to place.
Practical application: The typological maps will allow local authorities to prioritise adaptive actions in
urban planning in response to the urban heat island, an emerging climate-related challenge that has a
significant impact on the comfort and health of its citizens and on the (future) energy use required for
cooling buildings. Raising the albedo in those areas of the city that are dominated by impervious surface
cover seems an effective adaptation strategy, suitable to a city such as Amsterdam that no longer builds on
green field sites but only builds as possible within the envelope of the existing city. Improving the quality of
life in neighbourhoods and the energy efficiency/climate proofing of the building stock could also be
prioritised in the identified neighbourhoods.},

The model is applied to different types of EO sensors and is formalized by the Open Geospatial Consortium Sensor Model Language 1.0. The GeosensorQuery prototype retrieves the qualified EO sensors based on the provided geo-event. An actual application to flood emergency observation in the Yangtze River Basin in China is conducted, and the results indicate that sensor inquiry can accurately achieve fine-grained discovery of qualified EO sensors and obtain enriched observation capability information. In summary, the proposed model enables an efficient encoding system that ensures minimum unification to represent the observation capabilities of EO sensors. The model functions as a foundation for the efficient discovery of EO sensors. In addition, the definition and development of this proposed EO sensor observation capability metadata model is a helpful step in extending the Sensor Model Language (SensorML) 2.0 Profile for the description of the observation capabilities of EO sensors.},

In this sense the article is very much in line with my thesis, although it focuses very much on small scale sensor networks (sensors inside one building) and it does not use the OGC SWE standards. Nonetheless it is an import reference for my research since the idea of the "information oriented architecture" which allows the sensor data to be understood and
processed in a meaningful way by a variety of applications with different purposes is similar to my idea of the SSW.

Since the W3C SSN standard has only been created after the publication of this article it does not implement it yet.

The proposed Semantic Web Architecture for Sensor Networks (SWANS) consists of 4 layers: Sensor Network Data Sources, Ontology Layer, Semantic Web Processing Layer and Application Layer (see figure 2, page 458). This architecture might be useful for my own proof of concept application.},

It focuses on the problem of assigning meaningful URIs.

Observation is the act in which sensors perceive stimuli and translate them into another, often digital, representation. Typically, we are not interested in these stimuli but in what they tell us about the properties of particular real word entities - the features of interest. However, it is difficult to determine which features to link to. Therefore, links to different kinds of features can be made. Also, this paper suggests a method of providing a ' vague' region with a certain confidence level.

Meaningful URIs, links, and vocabularies are the essential building blocks of Linked (Open) Data, while the machine-readable RDF is rather an enabling encoding that provides some basic reasoning support in addition. The main O&M components associated with an observation and offered by
an SOS are features of interest, sensors (procedures), and observed properties. The URIs are assigned to these components by appending the component type to the URI identifying the authority.},

  Abstract                 = {The vision of a Digital Earth calls for more dynamic information systems,
new sources of information, and stronger capabilities for their integration.
Sensor networks have been identified as a major information source for
the Digital Earth, while Semantic Web technologies have been proposed to
facilitate integration.. So far, sensor data is stored and published using the
Observations & Measurements standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium
(OGC) as data model. With the advent of Volunteered Geographic Information
and the Semantic SensorWeb, work on an ontological model gained importance
within Sensor Web Enablement (SWE). In contrast to data models,
an ontological approach abstracts from implementation details by focusing
on modeling the physical world from the perspective of a particular domain.
Ontologies restrict the interpretation of vocabularies towards their intended
meaning. The ongoing paradigm shift to Linked Sensor Data complements
this attempt. Two questions have to be addressed: (i) how to refer to changing
and frequently updated data sets using Uniform Resource Identifiers, and
(ii) how to establish meaningful links between those data sets, i.e., observations,
sensors, features of interest, and observed properties? In this paper, we
present a Linked Data model and a RESTful proxy for OGC’s Sensor Observation

  Review                   = {This article describes the process of linking sensor data to the semantic web. It introduced a Linked Data model to combine OGC’s Sensor Observation Service with the Linked Data cloud. This takes shape as a RESTful server. There are detailed decsriptions of how to create such a RESTful proxy.

The implementation of this paper takes a SOS service and builts a semantic 'facade' in front of it. This is contrary to the thesis idea of creating a way of connecting SOS services to the semantic web via a third-party service that is seperate from the SOS services. "Based on the scheme introduced
in section 3.2, the RESTful proxy extracts the user’s query from the URI, encodes it into valid SOS queries, fetches the results from the underlying SOS, and converts them (after according content negotiation) to an RDF representation aligned with the Linked Data model"

While the OGC has standardized Web Services which follow a state-full request-response pattern and are designed based on the publish-find-bind paradigm of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) (Mazzetti et al., 2009), Linked Data explicitly aims at breaking up such data silos. Instead, it proposes a Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA) which is focused on distributed capabilities and services.

Both O&M and SSN are not sufficient to address the needs of Linked Data. While O&M supports unique identifiers, it currently does neither prescribe the use of HTTP URI’s, the persistence of identifiers, nor clear and flexible linking strategies between resources.

There is hardly any context-free sensor data. In most cases raw data will be of limited value. The selection, processing, and publication of data using URIs already involves making certain decisions, e.g., about the features of interest.

So far, links expressed as RDF predicates do not support a temporal scoping.},

The article states very well the relevance of this kind of research: while SWE standards are very useful, they are by themselves insufficient to realize knowledge-based reasoning and discovery and it does not state essence relations among data clearly. In order to obtain further information and knowledge, researchers propose SSW by adding semantics through domain ontology and spatial and temporal ontology to the existing sensor network language standards.

We believe SSW, combining SWE with semantic web and ontology, is considered as a framework that enhances the expressiveness of sensor data, provides abundant and meaningful semantic descriptions, and realizes sensor knowledge reasoning.

In this article 5 areas for future research are presented: Real-time Search in Semantic Sensor Web, Ontology Construction for Semantic Sensor Web, Data Fusion in Semantic Sensor Web, Semantic Annotations in semantic Sensor Web, and Application Developments methodology for Semantic Sensor Web. About data fusion in the semantic web is states: Recent research trends focus on transforming the sensor-based data into RDF and making it available using HTTP with the help of sensor-related URIs. Other work being done is to provide semantic queries that are adapted to sensed-based data. However, these methodologies still cannot complete the data integration or data fusion work.},

structured techniques to interlink and semantically describe spatial information. It
is currently not possible to use LOD as a data source for OGC web services. In

LOD as a data source, and we explore and discuss its benefits. We describe and test

require diverse monitoring, processing and dissemination systems

data in a format usable for other applications such as
planning, assessing population exposure and environmental

near national borders, international cooperation within this
domain is highly desirable. This manuscript reports lessons
learned during the implementation phase of one the world’s
largest data harmonisation effort of environmental information
infrastructures, INSPIRE, a backbone of a European wide

within the context of the Digital Earth concept and the establishment
of a global spatial data infrastructure (SDI) through
the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), as
the quality of ambient air is among the most pressing contemporary
environmental problems. We summarise our findings
from the perspective of national public authorities, obliged by
law to transmit standardised spatio-temporal data to
streamline reporting and facilitate the use of information,
while keeping public expenditure under control. To develop
implementation strategies for these type of e-reporting data
flows we established a cross-border case study, looking at the
process of harmonisation and exchange of data in Belgium
and the Netherlands based on interoperable standards. Our
results cover the legal, semantic, technological and
organisational aspects of reporting. They are relevant to a
cross-thematic audience having to undergo similar processes
of reporting, such as climate change, environmental noise,
marine, biodiversity, water management, etc.},

This manuscript reports lessons learned during the implementation phase of one the world’s largest data harmonisation effort of environmental information
infrastructures, INSPIRE, a backbone of a European wide spatial data reporting system which involves an unprecedented number of actors and volumes of data. It is important within the context of the Digital Earth concept and the establishment of a global spatial data infrastructure (SDI) through the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), as the quality of ambient air is among the most pressing contemporary environmental problems.

They identify a number of challenges which should be addressed in order to streamline e-reporting and value adding. In our study we identified that open source software as the preferred development paradigm. traditionally many of the existing practices have been implemented with centralization of data and redistribution of a final product on behalf of those who contributed the data. Now, with the emergence of the SOA as architecture it is technically completely feasible to adopt similar practices for data transmission on both country and international level. We discovered that INSPIRE and the requirements stemming out of the air quality specific legislation are not fully aligned, particularly with respect to whether data should be exposed through the establishment of distributed service oriented architecture, or centralized and disseminated through the EEA on behalf of the member countries. That is why supranational environmental legislation having to do with sharing and transmission of information should be better coordinated and lay down data exchange principles which are unambiguous.

There are several important lessons to be learned which can lead to improvement of INSPIRE implementation in the mid to long term which are discussed below and are related to (1) extending the focus of the data infrastructure beyond the geospatial domain, and (2) provision of working examples with data and services for their viewing, downloading and discovery. Good candidates to be considered for provision of information in near-real time are the standards organized within the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework.},

nowadays supported by Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) in order to find, access and utilize

Infrastructures (e.g. administrative boundaries) by now, sensor information need new
standards to realize the integration of this dynamic data into SDI. These new challenge was
handled by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) within its Sensor Web Enablement
(SWE) initiative. Several standards to administrate, detect and receive sensor data were
passed, for example a Sensor Observation Service (SOS). For validating the standards of
the SWE there are already existing applications using sensor information that is provided by
a SOS. But those cases are predominantly designed for 2D data. This paper demonstrates
an approach to integrate sensor information into a 3D-client of a 3D-SDI completely based
on the standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium. This leads to the new concept of
dynamic 3D SDIs. An according prototype has already been implemented and will be

makers by providing them with an improved situational awareness

sensor modalities such that the resulting output is better (i.e.,
more accurate, complete, dependable etc.) than what it would
have been if the data streams (hereinafter referred to as ‘feeds’)
from the resources are taken individually. However, these feeds
lack any context-related information (e.g., detected event, event
classification, relationships to other events, etc.). This hinders the
fusion process and may result in creating an incorrect picture
about the situation. Thus, results in false alarms, waste valuable
time/resources.
In this paper, we propose an approach that enriches feeds with
semantic attributes so that these feeds have proper meaning. This
will assist underlying applications to present analysts with correct
feeds for a particular event for fusion. We argue annotated
stored feeds will assist in easy retrieval of historical data that
may be related to the current fusion. We use a subset of
Web Ontology Language (OWL) [1], OWL-DL to present a
lightweight and efficient knowledge layer for feeds annotation
and use rules to capture crucial domain concepts. We discuss
a solution architecture and provide a proof-of-concept tool to
evaluate the proposed approach. We discuss the importance of
such an approach with a set of use-cases and show how a tool
like the one proposed could assist analysts, planners to make
better-informed decisions.

  Abstract                 = {Linked Data is a method to publish data on the Web and originates from the Informatics sector. The data model exists of subject and object which are connected through the predicate. These three elements can be depicted with web pages. Governments and municipalities open up their data and publish spatial data on the Web, to be transparent to their citizens and to stimulate innovation. This spatial open data can be confusing for users since data is published as either typical GIS-formats or metadata is missing or sparsely available. Linked Data could benefit to that regard. The 5 star scheme from Tim Berners-Lee defines a model to publish open data as linked data on the Web so that additional information can be looked up. Data as linked data is considered more user friendly, understandable, re-useable and accessible for all users and converting spatial data to spatial linked data aids in integrating spatial data on the Web. Ordnance Survey has already published spatial datasets as spatial linked data and lately in the Netherlands organizations such as Geonovum and the Kadaster and companies are exploring this subject.
The research done for this master thesis focuses on how to apply the linked data method for spatial open data in order to profit from the benefits of linked data. This research provides a methodology to create spatial linked open data. In the case study for the Municipality of Rotterdam, four spatial open datasets concerning the composition of areas and neighborhoods in Rotterdam Zuid are converted to spatial linked open data to exemplify the possibilities and limitations for spatial linked open data.
The case study showed that there are multiple users who can benefit from spatial linked open data, divided in two user types do layman users benefit in a better understanding of the data better and finding related information. The expert users benefit in the asking of spatial queries over the data. This can be used to create an inventory or simple analysis over the data. For more complicated queries, for transformations and data processing a GIS is needed.
The results showed that modeling spatial data according to the OGC standard for spatial linked data, the GeoSPARQL ontology, provides the possibility to ask spatial queries over the data to do a simple analysis or inventory over multiple heterogeneous and distributed datasets, by dynamically and implicitly linking datasets together on their location. As of now, not all tools for creating linked data support spatial data yet, therefore it can be time consuming to convert the data to spatial linked data. The on-the-fly method, where the actual data is converted on the fly to linked data would be ideal, in terms of data management, since the data is more up-to-date and not copied. Spatial linked open data has benefit in cross knowledge domain issues where multiple heterogeneous datasets are required, such as in emergency management and urban planning.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews the origins, definitions, trends and pathways of knowledge about
future cities and the future of cities. In particular, it examines the different terms and
phrases that are used by key stakeholders concerned with the future of cities. Its
findings are based on an extensive English-language source and literature review of
relevant publications, reports, projects and online press. It identifies key developments
in future thinking and practice amongst governments, corporations, institutions and
citizens at the local and global level.
The future of cities discourse is over a century old and has encompassed at least
four cycles of thinking about the nature, purpose and destiny of cities. Today’s
cycle of future city thinking is distinctive for its global, positive, strategic,
integrated, and evidence-led character.
Future city terminology can convey either environmental, social, economic or
governance aims, or a hybrid of some or all of these elements. Although terms
such as ‘garden city’, ‘inclusive city’, ‘competitive city’ and ‘intelligent city’ tend
to refer to one specific domain, the more commonly used terms tend to have
broad, hybrid or ambiguous meanings. This especially applies to current
phrases such as ‘smart cities’, ‘sustainable cities’, ‘future cities’ and ‘liveable
cities’. The high degree of conceptual crossover and overlap means most terms
are highly compatible with each other, but reflect different sources or alliances,
often with a desire to suggest conceptual differentiation despite substantive
overlap.
Sustainability is no longer the main prism through which thinking about the
future of cities takes place. The ‘sustainable city’ was the most cited English
language term in the future cities discourse in the 1990s and early 2000s, as
awareness and consensus of the human impact on the environment grew.
Although the literature on sustainable cities has continued to mount up, its
popularity as a news and search term has declined since 2006.
‘Smart cities’ has become the most popular formulation for the future city, and
is becoming a globally recognised term, replacing or co-existing with terms in
other languages. The ‘smart city’ has displaced the ‘sustainable city’ and ‘digital
city’ as the word of choice to denote ICT-led urban innovation, and new modes
of governance and urban citizenship. It is also the only English language term
to have become widely used in continental Europe.
‘Eco cities’ emerged as an important term for projects in Asian cities in the mid-
2000s, and is still widely used in Asia and the Middle East to describe a model
of low-carbon urbanism for individual districts and sometimes whole cities.
The term has become less common since 2009, and has been linked to a
5
number of unsuccessful or criticised projects in China and UAE. A similar trend
is observed with ‘digital cities’, a term found to be used in most continents, but
whose appeal has been displaced by the broader concern of ‘smart cities’.
A small cluster of thought leaders, knowledge centres, inter-governmental
bodies and multi-national technology firms are the vanguard of future city
thinking and practice. Ideas of city systems, systems of cities, integrated,
connected, compact, flexible and resilient cities have all been successfully
packaged and promoted by these influential ‘generators’ whose cutting edge
R&D shapes the framework and market for government ‘customers’ and ‘endusers’.
National and local governments adopt future city ideals and ‘demonstrator’
projects as solutions to short-term challenges, to develop international profile
and to build shared identity and purpose. Other future city ‘adopters’ include
corporate sponsors of urban dialogue, one stop-shop technology solution
providers, taught academic programmes, philanthropic organisations, media
outlets and city benchmarking studies.
Cities also adopt future city vocabulary in an attempt to become better
equipped to plan and shape their futures, as they acquire and build new
governance systems, finance tools, data streams, and city management
techniques.
Formal and informal citizenship engagement with future cities has become
more inventive and collaborative. Citizens adapt future city language to their
aspirations for quality of life, safety, design, culture and vibrancy, and pursue
them through crowd-funding, crowdsourcing, DIY solutions and political
campaigns, among other means.
The science of cities is still emerging and has not yet generated global language
norms. It is also an inter-disciplinary science, and this makes clarity of concepts
harder to achieve. A more consistent and globally accepted set of principles for
future cities may, paradoxically, take shape over the next decade, but it is likely
that this will happen at the same time as local and corporate propositions and
terminologies continue to multiply.
The discourse of future cities is becoming more multi-disciplinary, more
evidence-led and more conceptually watertight, but descriptions and
imaginations of the future city will always reflect the changing way that cities
are perceived to matter to society, the environment, and the economy, and will
also reflect the competitive dynamics between cities and the firms and
institutions that seek to serve them.},

interoperable Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) across Europe. EU member states are already providing
such services for several geospatial data themes (e.g., transportation networks, administrative units).
Unfortunately, the INSPIRE ecosystem has been largely disjoint from the Semantic Web, without any
means to repurpose existing SDIs as high-quality data sources, and thus multiply their value through
interlinking, reasoning and inferencing. In this paper, we introduce a methodology that can assist
stakeholders in exposing INSPIRE-aligned SDIs on the Semantic Web according to the recent GeoSPARQL
standard. We develop methods for discovering INSPIRE data through a virtual SPARQL endpoint over
existing INSPIRE catalogue services. Further, we implement a suite of tools for automatically transforming
INSPIRE data and metadata into RDF triples with geometries. The compiled geographic and thematic
information can then be loaded into semantic repositories for querying or interlinked with other data. Our
open-source solutions essentially repurpose existing INSPIRE SDIs, so as to promote uptake and facilitate
their reuse in practice. Finally, as a case study, we report our experience in validating this approach on a
real-world SDI with publicly available data for Greece in order to expose its contents through (Geo)SPARQL
endpoints.},

By 2020, the under way INSPIRE in Europe will enable discovery, download, and visualization of geospatial information in a common, cross-boundary manner. Unfortunately, the INSPIRE ecosystem has been largely disjoint from the Semantic Web.

The goal of this article is to devise effective methods for automatically exposing INSPIRE data and metadata as Linked Open Data (LOD). This is done in the form of a middleware between the semantic web (GeoSPARQL), the metadata catalogues and the downloadable RDF triples. (see figure 4.2 at page 4)

This work deals with the first group of data themes, as specified in Annex I. This does not yet include the sensor data under the theme "environmental monitoring facilities".

At present, no complete INSPIRE ontology in RDF/OWL exists. This reflects the difficulty of bridging the ‘‘closed world’’ assumption of UML models in INSPIRE with the ‘‘open world’’ view of RDF. However, this is a common problem with a number of studies addressing this already.},

based on these themes:
 Smart Cities are high-density generators of innovation and information.
 Location information is a major enabler of Smart City technology benefits.
 Benefits of smart technology must be judged by benefits to residents.
 Reuse and repurpose is vital to urban resilience
 Open standards are needed for interoperability, efficiency, application innovation
and cost effectiveness.
Discussion of these themes and this white paper will occur at the OGC Smart Cities
Location Powers Summit in Tokyo on December 2, 2014,1 the co-located OGC Technical
Committee meeting, and in many other forums in the future. As described in this paper,
there are many standards initiatives that focus on Smart Cities. Most Smart Cities use
cases in some way involve indoor and/or outdoor location, and thus communication about
location is an issue that cuts across the work programs most of the standards
organizations that are involved with Smart Cities.

  Abstract                 = {With sensors, storage, and bandwidth becoming ever cheaper, there has been a drive
recently to make sensor data accessible on the Web. However, because of the vast number
of sensors collecting data about our environment, finding relevant sensors on the
Web and then interpreting their observations is a non-trivial challenge. The Open Geospatial
Consortium (OGC) defines a web service specification known as the Sensor Observation
Service (SOS) that is designed to standardize the way sensors and sensor data are
discovered and accessed on the Web. Though this standard goes a long way in providing
interoperability between sensor data producers and consumers, it is predicated on the
idea that the consuming application is equipped to handle raw sensor data.
Sensor data consuming end-points are generally interested in not just the raw data
itself, but rather actionable information regarding their environment. The approaches
for dealing with this are either to make each individual consuming application smarter
or to make the data served to them smarter. This thesis presents an application of the
latter approach, which is accomplished by providing a more meaningful representation of
sensor data by leveraging semantic web technologies. Specifically, this thesis describes an
approach to sensor data modeling, reasoning, discovery, and query over richer semantic
data derived from raw sensor descriptions and observations.
v
The artifacts resulting from this research include:
• an implementation of an SOS service which hews to both Sensor Web and Semantic
Web standards in order to bridge the gap between syntactic and semantic
sensor data consumers and that has been proven by use in a number of research
applications storing large amounts of data, which serves as
• an example of an approach for designing applications which integrate syntactic
services over semantic models and allow for interactions with external reasoning
systems.
As more sensors and observations move online and as the Internet of Things becomes
a reality, issues of integration of sensor data into our everyday lives will become important
for all of us. The research represented by this thesis explores this problem space and
presents an approach to dealing with many of these issues. Going forward, this research
may prove a useful elucidation of the design considerations and affordances which can
allow low-level sensor and observation data to become the basis for machine processable
knowledge of our environment.},

This article discusses a semantic sensor Web (SSW) in which sensor data is annotated with semantic metadata to increase interoperability as well as provide
contextual information essential for situational knowledge. In particular, this involves annotating sensor data with spatial, temporal, and thematic semantic metadata. A semantically rich sensor network would provide spatial, temporal, and thematic information essential for discovering and analyzing sensor data.

Whereas the languages provided by the OGC SWE provide annotations for simple spatial and temporal concepts such as spatial coordinate and time stamp, more abstract concepts, such as spatial region, temporal interval, or any domain-specific thematic entity, would benefit from an ontological representation’s expressiveness. 

The semantics of the time interval specified by the query could be about weather conditions that fall within the time interval, contain the time interval, or overlap with the time interval.

The article briefly explains the mapping between XML and RDFa (page 81). 

It mentions that: several efforts are also underway to design an expressive geospatial ontology, including the W3C Geospatial Incubator Group and the Geographic Markup Language Ontology of the OGC. The results of this effort are presented in Compton et al. (2012).

The article states that to derive additional knowledge from semantically annotated sensor data, it’s necessary to define and use rules. For this they use Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)- based rules over OWL ontologies.

The use cases presented here involve semantics for better understanding the data from a single source. There is no mentioning of integrating sensor data from different sources based on semantics.},

This paper investigates how work on sensor observation aggregation can be incorporated into a Linked Data framework focusing on external linkage as well as provenance information. 

In other communities, e.g., the database community or in environmental sciences, spatio-temporal aggregation has been a research topic for years and is sometimes also referred to as scaling of observations and environmental models. A spatio-temporal aggregation service that can be used to provide such aggregation functionality on the Sensor Web has been introduced in our previous work (towards a spatiotemporal aggregation service in the sensor web, 2011).

Definition of aggregation: During an aggregation process, the observations are grouped by a grouping predicate, e.g., by a spatial predicate which is defned by the polygon representing the area of a city, or by a temporal predicate defned by the time period of a month. After grouping, an aggregation function is applied that computes a single value, an aggregate, for the result values of an observation group. 

For aggregation of observations a mechanism that helps to retrace the original observations and sensors from the aggregated observations is important. Linked Data provides a promising paradigm to provide such a mechanism, as the original observations and the aggregates can be easily linked with clear semantics.

Provenance of sensor data can be defned as information about the source of the sensor data as well as information about transformations applied to the original data. The proposed approach shows how most of relevant provenance information is already provided in our Linked Sensor Data and how the links can be mapped to provenance relationships as defned in the OPM (Open Provenance Model).

The main contributions of this paper are threefold. They (i) present a Linked Data model for aggregated sensor data, (ii) discuss the effects of aggregation on links from and to observations, and (iii) outline the role of provenance in this setting.

The authors have extende the W3C SSO (SSN) ontology with 4 extra classes: isAggregateOf, SensingDevice, ggregationProcess and AggregationProcedure.},

summing observation values over an area, is currently judged by domain experts using their knowledge

This involves, in particular, knowledge about phenomena represented by data and models, as well as
about underlying procedures. In this paper, we introduce a novel notion of meaningfulness of prediction
and aggregation. To this end, we present a formal theory about spatio-temporal variable types, observation
procedures, as well as interpolation and aggregation procedures relevant in Spatial Statistics.
Meaningfulness is defined as correspondence between functions and data sets, the former representing
data generation procedures such as observation and prediction. Comparison is based on semantic reference
systems, which are types of potential outputs of a procedure. The theory is implemented in higher-order
logic (HOL), and theorems about meaningfulness are proved in the semi-automated prover Isabelle. The
type system of our theory is available as a Web Ontology Language (OWL) pattern for use in the Semantic
Web. In addition, we show how to implement a data-model recommender system in the statistics tool
environment R. We consider our theory groundwork to automate semantic interoperability of data and
models.},

Not for all sensor data this is aggregation makes sense: summing temperature measurements or interpolating point source emissions is not meaningful. This paper formalises meaningfulness
of applying prediction and aggregation procedures to data. In order to provide support from information systems for automatically discouraging or proposing prediction or aggregation methods for a dataset, expert knowledge needs to be formalized.

It focuses on the aggregation of point data (either point patterns or geostatistical variables) to areal data.

The basic idea of our formalism is a formal distinction between 'representations of procedures as functions', which capture knowledge about potential operations such as observing or predicting phenomena, and 'representations of data sets as predicates over function domains', which denote limited (finite) results of applying such operations.

One challenge for future work consists in tractable implementations of meaningfulness checks in open Semantic Web environments as well as in statistical software.},

  Abstract                 = {The urban heat island (UHI) describes the phenomena that the city heats up faster and stays
warmer than its rural surroundings. The combination of ageing societies and increasing
temperature, due to climate change, poses serious challenges for the health and wellbeing of
the increasing urban population. Assessments of the urban heat island effect, so far use
predominantly remote sensing methods, which don’t allow us to understand the crucial indoor
temperatures. Therefore, this Master Thesis is focussing on the optimization of a technique for
creating a three-dimensional (3D) model showing the indoor temperatures of an urban area,
Rotterdam. The method created in this research is a reusable method that can be applied on
other urban heat island region if necessary data is available. The output of this research, a 3D
model, functions as a tool for urban planners and designers to help them understanding local
differences in the urban temperature allowing them to develop strategies for the reconfiguration
of a building, block or neighbourhood.
Data from a variety of data sources is acquired and used to create this model of which the most
important data is coming from approximately 1300 temperature sensors that have been
distributed over the city Rotterdam during the summer of 2014. Data coming from these
sensors, the sampled data, is linked to a developed 3D model representing all addresses within
the urban area of Rotterdam. Linking the sensor data to the 3D model does the transformation
form aspatial sensor data into spatial sensor data. Data modelling is done for estimating indoor
temperatures for all addresses of Rotterdam by analysing the sensed data and the spatial
environment of each address of which sensor data is available. The original sensor data is
used to validate and to determine the accuracy of the modelled temperatures. The modelled
temperatures are visualised per adders by assigning colour gradient to the addresses
according to their temperature.},

warmer and more vulnerable than are other areas of Rotterdam. The temperature
readings that were carried out confirm these findings as far as outdoor
temperatures are concerned. Indoor temperatures vary widely. Homes seem to
have their own dynamics, in which the house’s age plays a role.
The above-average mortality of those aged 75 and over during the July 2006 heat
wave in Rotterdam can be easily explained on the basis of a) the concentration
of people in this age group, b) the age of the homes they live in, and c) the sum of
sensible heat and ground heat flux.
A varying mix of impervious surfaces, surface water, foliage, building envelopes
and shade make one area or district warmer than another.
Adaptation measures are in the hands of residents, home owners and the local
council alike, and relate to changing behaviour, physical measures for homes, and
urban design respectively},

Temperatures in homes are generally higher than those in the surrounding area, and also show a large degree of variation. Indoor temperatures are less affected by local outdoor temperatures than we had expected.

Performance tests revealed that observation publishing times with our experimental system were well within limits compatible with the adequate operation of smart safety assistance systems in vehicles. On the other hand, response times for complex queries on large repositories may be inappropriate for rapid reaction needs.},

Standardization efforts like SWE still need to be extended to all the interfaces that can be identified between the lower layer, represented by sensor networks and smart devices, and the upper layer of final applications. In our view, the OGC SWE represents a mature standard interface between the Sensor Web Layer and the Application Layer. Universal standards for the interface between the Sensor Web and the underlying Sensor Layer, however, are still an open issue.

The main goal is to examine and survey different sensor data fusion research efforts based on our evaluation framework. 

The concept of Sensor Data Fusion is described as well its relevance in the IoT. It can be described as a data processing technique that associates, combines, aggregates, and integrates data fromdifferentsources. The article mentions three key operations of sensor data fusion: complementary (creating a large picture from small bits of information), redundant (integrate sensors for improved accuracy), and cooperative (combine sensors to produce new knowledge). The ultimate goal of sensor data fusion is to under- stand the environment and act accordingly. 

My thesis will be focused on the complementary and redundant aspects of sensor data fusion with the future option of cooperative through links in the semantic web. 

There is very little interest in the raw sensor data. The data that is of significant interest is information about interesting events that are happening in the specific area.

The ten parameters are: Middleware Architecture Type, Context-awareness, Semantic Interaction, Dynamic Configuration, Fusion Complexity, Actuation Management, Type of Processing, Cross Domain Portability, Implementation and Performance Evaluation.

Using middleware in semantic sensor network architectures is about creating an abstraction level, which results in a degraded performance over applications that directly consult the sensors. However, middleware systems can bundle important functionalities together to be reused in many applications. The article identifies developing middleware as the right way to address the needs of IoT applications.

Connecting sensors to the semantic web (Semantic Sensor Web) is mentioned as an important step to increase the retrievability of sensor data.

The article describes the potential of IoT and evaluates a number of 'state of the art' examples of Sensor Data Fusion. Table 1: Taxonomy of Sensor Data Fusion Research Efforts contains a taxonomy of a couple dozen researches.},

This paper focusses specifically to an urban IoT system that, while still being quite a broad category, are characterized by their specific application domain. 

Under the political dimension, the primary obstacle is the attribution of decision-making power to the different stakeholders. On the technical side, the most relevant issue consists in the noninteroperability of the heterogeneous technologies currently used in city and urban developments. In this respect, the IoT vision can become the building block to realize a unified urbanscale ICT platform.

A number of use cases are identified: Structural Health of Buildings, Waste Management, Air Quality, Noise Monitoring, Traffic Congestion, City Energy Consumption, Smart Lighting and Automation and Salubrity of Public Buildings.

A fundamental aspect is the necessity to make (part of) the data collected by the urban IoT easily accessible by authorities and citizens, to increase the responsiveness of authorities to city problems, and to promote the awareness and the participation of citizens in public matters.

The paper mentions that XML is often too verbose and large for small IoT devices and therefore W3C has developed the EXI format, which makes it possible even for very constrained devices to natively support and generate messages using an open data format compatible with XML.},
