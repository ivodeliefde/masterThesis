\section{Semantics in Sensor Observation Services}
The metadata in \aclp{sos} does not necessarily contain semantics. This is an issue when automatically retrieving metadata from different services. In the implementation this has caused a problem with identifying which observable properties in a \ac{sos} are the same as observable properties found in another \ac{sos}. 


\section{Spatial queries with GeoSPARQL}
GeoSPARQL allows spatial queries in which a geometry can be inserted in the query. The implementation uses this functionality to test for spatial relations between geometries. For example between the point geometry of a sensor and the polygon geometry of an administrative unit. However, when geometries become more complicated their \ac{wkt} definition becomes more verbose. This results in the \ac{sparql} endpoint to reject the query based on its number of characters.
