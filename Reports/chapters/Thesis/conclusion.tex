\section{Research question}
This thesis aims to design a method that uses the semantic web to improve sensor data discovery as well as the integration and aggregation of sensor data from multiple sources. The following question will be answered in this research:   
\textit{To what extent can the semantic web improve the discovery, integration and aggregation of distributed sensor data?} \\

Subquestions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item To what extent can sensor metadata be automatically retrieved from a SOS and published
	on the semantic web?
	\item How can metadata on the semantic web be linked to relevant features-of-interest using
	existing vocabularies?
	\item To what extent can already existing standards for retrieving geographic data be used for
	a service that supplies integrated and aggregated sensor data?
\end{itemize}
