\chapter*{Abstract}


This thesis aims to design a method that uses the semantic web to improve sensor data discovery as well as the integration and aggregation of sensor data from multiple sources.

Literature about the \acf{swe} standards, the \acf{csw}, semantic web technologies and so-called sensor data middleware is analysed. 

The outline of a method is presented to automatically create an online semantic knowledge base of sensor metadata. It is also presented how such a knowledge base can be used to automatically translate logical queries of users to technical queries for retrieving observation data from \acf{sos}.  

Based on this method a proof of concept application has been created.
