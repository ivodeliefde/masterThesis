This thesis is the result of several months of hard work, and the support of many people. I would first of all like to thank my supervisors Marian de Vries en Martijn Meijers. You have guided me throughout the whole process and regularly took the time to help me reflect on my thesis. Thank you for all of your help and inspiration.   

Special thanks goes out to Michel Grothe from Geonovum, for introducing me to the SOS data sources and the ways in which they can be accessed. I would also like to thank my coreader Sisi Zlatanova and the delegate of the board of examiners Verena Balz. Your critical feedback has been very important in the process of writing the thesis. 

I would like to thank the thesis coordinator Hugo Ledoux, for shedding light on all the different aspects of the graduation manual. Another special thanks goes out to Florian Fichtner for his valuable peer review. I would also like to express my gratitude to all the Geomatics teachers and staff members, of whom I have learned a lot during my time in Delft. You have provided me with all the necessary knowledge and skills to make it this far. 

Finally, I would like to thank all of my friends and family who have supported me over the course of the last couple of months.
