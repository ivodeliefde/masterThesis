\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

This thesis is the result of several months of hard work, and the support of many people. I would first of all like to thank my supervisors Marian de Vries en Martijn Meijers. You have guided me throughout the whole process and regularly took the time to help me reflect on my thesis. Thank you for all of your help and inspiration.   

Special thanks goes out to Michel Grothe from Geonovum, for introducing me to the SOS data sources and how they can be accessed. The critical feedback of my coreader Sisi Zlatanova and of the delegate of the board of examiners Verena Balz has also been very important in the process of writing the thesis. 

I would like to thank the thesis coordinator Hugo Ledoux as well, for shedding light on all the different aspects of the graduation manual. Another special thanks goes out to Florian Fichtner for his valuable peer review. 

I would like to express my gratitude to all the Geomatics teachers and staff members of whom I have learned a lot during my master. You have provided me with the knowledge and skills to make it this far. 

Finally, I would like to thank all of my friends and family who supported me over the course of the last couple of months.
